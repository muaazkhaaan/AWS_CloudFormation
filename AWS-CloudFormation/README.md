### AWS CloudFormation

## Requirements
- [AWS CLI installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- Knowledge of Git

## Information
Each lesson will build upon the previous work, slowly building up a CloudFormation project adding additional resources in each lesson.

For running CloudFormation it can be done via the UI, for the sake of these lessons it will be done via the AWS CLI within PowerShell.
