# Getting AWS Credentials into AWS CLI

First login to [https://answerdigital.awsapps.com/start/#/](https://answerdigital.awsapps.com/start/#/) with your Answer microsoft credentials. (At the time of this writing you will need to do this in Chrome).

Once logged in you should have the `Answer Academy` account listed (If not ask your academy guide). 

Expand this and click `Access keys` this will open a modal. For the sake of all of these lessons we will be using `PowerShell` so click that tab.

Copy the contents of the box in `Option 1` and paste into your PowerShell window that you are using for the lessons.

These keys will expire after a time, refresh the account list page and repeat the steps above.
